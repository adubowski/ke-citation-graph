       "'All the Love you do not see\\n\\nOn writing with heart and hope\\n\\nPhoto by JOSHUA COLEMAN on Unsplash\\n\\nThe words I do not recognize are the ones my heart wrote, so feverish with hope every line feels like a hallucination.\\n\\nAnd yet, these moments happened and still happen, everything is true. Suddenly, life is poetry and joy opens up portal into new universes that leave you speechless. Unless you surrender to it, you cannot experience awe; that surrender is not verbal. Transcription takes place well after the facts and always feels like an unreliable witness account.\\n\\nFinding yourself writing love letters to life as a chronic depressive freelancer on the verge of financial collapse is weird but I’m here for it. Against the stark backdrop of death and destruction, life is more beautiful than ever, and I am, dare I say it, content.\\n\\nThere is so much gentleness in the generosity of acceptance, it frees up mental bandwidth for everything else. The moment is as impermanent as life. To not celebrate it would be an affront to hope, the same hope that has seen me through everything so far.\\n\\nI shouldn’t be here anymore but I am. Despair has shades and nuances, hope is blinding, and I have been dazed and confused since I set aside the past and embraced the present almost two years ago.\\n\\nHope is the blank page beckoning your heart to release its findings.\\n\\nSo others might benefit from them.'"
